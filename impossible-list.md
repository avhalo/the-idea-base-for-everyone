## 1. Machine Learning general
 * The start for every ml-task
        This is that it takes user input and redirects to tutorials,
        learning or generated (python) scripts which feature the dataset
        and try to solve the tasks. See below for the tasks
 These from scratch
 * Markov chains

        Super: detect accent
        fix accent
        and the rest of logopedy (fix monotony, wpm, "R/L/S",diftongs, etc)
        fix problem from first language: eg asian, italians, 
        korean example of IPA transformation: f -> p

 ### hc
 * LiteCMS (.md and latex support, grid selection etc)
    - wiki, news, blog, eshop, any: libraries libraries which bootsrapt also provides
    - for wiki and similar: create proposition for others to read

      and give a place for corrections and comments 
    - ai element: from a given site create similar, use cv to scan paper or gimp file
      auto post and create sports and events?
    - plugin
    - decide the language node/python? react/angular?
    - server side? Apache? nginx? 
    - Kirby?
 * statistical software:
   - inspiration: spss,r,excel, matlab
   - templates: a/b test summary
   - integrate into other frameworks
      - ie python libs, cms:es
   - create js-library 
   - factor analysis, time series, common economical calculations 
      for firms
   - explanation and documentation for all statistics with examples
   - 

## Networking and browsers
* Create lynx-like browser

* & Started from same level and age
* Using just mesmerized in rapid feedback loop
* Long loop of repetition (est mater studiorum)
* Brilliance of quick learners separeted from 
   not that oriented in natural languages
* Use of categories (WordNet) but also polysemous meaning
   and context
* Emphasis on common phrases and work/restaurant/everyday stuff
* Curse words first or curse words last?
* Lmao: Binary conversion and formation of multilanguages for polyglots
* etymological meaning and support of dead languages and dialects
* District/Tribe based historical frameworks
* Similar words as homonyms and homophones
* Syllable similarity for lyrically oriented?

* Why not this for all or at least for top 20(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6320220) and mobile only? Why?
* Detect or suggest a level autom.
* For introduction: translating all so funny "memes" shitty and controversial ex: "ootko pannulasta?"
* To think of it more there should be definitely (IPA crawled) syllable stuff: eg. your own name should have the fun things with it. One (easy) is have same starting letter. One is (hard) to have words that are alike with maximum amount of syllables
* HC detect own faults

## Fintech

 Yes life was simple in the 80s. Good graphics take time, even 8bit.
 Learn how to do pixel art.
 Also please, don't make 50mb of libraries to do something which fitted in 
 [less than mb](https://www.quora.com/Super-Mario-Bros-game-was-just-31-Kilobytes-Hows-that-possible). Extra points for using C.
 If you want to advance the game more goto 0. basic algorithms and 1. Machine learning
 * any website
 * [keylogger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BiOPBsXh0g)
 * Jeopardy

 TUIs

 C: ncurses

 GUIs
 psyide2 tkinter swing/javafx qt or plain html/css/js

Even this was too hard? Try [these](https://beginnersbook.com/2015/02/simple-c-programs/)

 UX is key element
 Some of the applications mentioned before too aren't that complex. [Here]() are tutorials
 Optimization is hard!

 See what programs/games/applications you like and fancy. Then just make them. Remember to Finish them! This is extremely important, nonfinished projects get you nowhere!
 Remember. Even Linus Torvalds did not start by making an operating system. 
 If you want to start doing a operating system start making a terminal emulator.
 Don't start too hard. If you want to do something break it to the parts and start 
 from the easiest task the get the flow and then move to the essential parts.
 Remember to document your code! Plus for designdoc! Group projects make you better 
 communicator and is a bonus for job interviews. don't be a loner.

 “I didn’t dislike it, but I was worried that it would encourage more people to use Manim. Do I want that? Hmm. I wrote the package for myself. It has never been tested."

 I'm sorry Dave, I didn't quite catch that
