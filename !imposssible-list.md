# The never-ending todo/project list
## Never forget these:
To be or not be
Feature creep

* make a software design docs and analyis documents

* codewars
* leetcode
* others
* blog/videos

## 0. Algorithm Basics
    * DFS
    * BFS
    * Djikstra
    * A*
    * Mazegenerators
    * Visual: Mesh

## 1. Machine Learning general
 * The start for every ml-task
        This is that it takes user input and redirects to tutorials,
        learning or generated (python) scripts which feature the dataset
        and try to solve the tasks. See below for the tasks
 These from scratch
 * Markov chains
 * Attention models
 * Deep learning
    ** LSTM
    ** CNN
    ** RNN
    ** Attention learning [is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
    
 * Reinforcement learning
 * How to avoid overfitting
 ### Possible projects regarding to ml
    * BERTing
    * Clustering problems ???
    * OCR/Tesseract

        Super: detect accent
        fix accent
        and the rest of logopedy (fix monotony, wpm, "R/L/S",diftongs, etc)
        fix problem from first language: eg asian, italians, 
        korean example of IPA transformation: f -> p
    * Create general importable game intelligences:
      - optimized paths with heuristics (follow roads avoid obstacles)
      - hardness level for battles. detect hardness from introduction
      - auto-lip-syncing?
      - play most common atari-games given the recorded screen
      - play most terminal games
      - withdraw from 

## 2. NLP
 * auto-completion
 * corpora
 *
 ### hc

 * genre-detection
 * meta-analysis


 ## Graphical 
 * Generate ascii-videos
 * Generate fractals flexible/set start and hausdorff 
    (start with mandelbrot 
     and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4
     and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s7h2MHQtxc)
 * visualize Algorithms

    - wiki, blog, eshop, any: libraries libraries which bootsrapt also provides

## Networking and browsers
* Create lynx-like browser
* Inspect traffic like wireshark send traffic like the other app
* 

## Software
 Task-follow
 * record task times (tabs open programs time spend online
    types of apps, the desktop version)
 * open ccleaner
 Terminal 4chan and reddit client (TUI)
 Simple server and properties
### Psychology
 * cognitive assesment
 * memory "enhancer"
 * IQ-tests
